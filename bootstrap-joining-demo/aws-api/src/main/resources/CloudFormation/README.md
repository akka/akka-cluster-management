Cloud Formation Scripts
=======================

Note that these files are in the resources folder, so that they can be read by an integration test. To use Cluster Bootstrap 
with EC2 Tag Based Discovery, you do not need to have these files in your resources folder.

Note: only works on N. Virginia region since these scripts reference an AMI image that is available on the N.Virginia region.
