# Akka Discovery Methods

As of version `0.50.0` of Akka Management [Akka Discovery](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/discovery/index.html) 
has become a core Akka module. Older versions of Service Discovery from Akka Management are not compatible with the 
Akka Discovery module in Akka.

Akka Management contains methods for:

 * @ref[Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
 * @ref[Consul](consul.md)
 * @ref[Marathon](marathon.md)
 * @ref[AWS](aws.md)
 
The Kubernetes method is known to be well used and tested. The others are community contributions that are not tested as 
part of the build and release process.
