## Consul

@@@ warning

This module is community maintained and the Lightbend subscription doesn't cover support for this module.
  It is also marked as @extref:[may change](akka:common/may-change.html).
  That means that the API, configuration or semantics can change without warning or deprecation period.

@@@

Consul currently ignores all fields apart from service name. This is expected to change.

If you are using Consul to do the service discovery this would allow you to base your Cluster on Consul services.

`akka-discovery-consul` can be used with Akka $akka.version$ or $akka.version26$ or later.
You have to override the following Akka dependencies by defining them explicitly in your build and
define the Akka version to the one that you are using. Latest patch version of Akka is recommended and
a later version than $akka.version26$ can be used.

  artifact=akka-cluster_$scala.binary.version$
  version=AkkaVersion
  group2=com.typesafe.akka
  artifact2=akka-discovery_$scala.binary.version$
  version2=AkkaVersion
}

In your application conf add:

```
akka.discovery {
  method = akka-consul
  akka-consul {

    #How to connect to Consul to fetch services data
    consul-host = "127.0.0.1"
    consul-port = 8500

    # the suffix to discover management service
    # your code should have logic to register SERVICE_NAME-akka-mangement to consul
    management-service-suffix = "-akka-management"
  }
}
```

In your code start bootstrap something like this:

```scala
// Akka Management hosts the HTTP routes used by bootstrap
val akkaManagement: AkkaManagement = AkkaManagement(system)

akkaManagement
  .start()
  .map { _ =>
    val consulAgent =
      Consul.builder().withHostAndPort(HostAndPort.fromParts("127.0.0.1", 8500)).build()
      val client = consulAgent.agentClient()
      client.register(
        /* port = */ akkaManagement.settings.getHttpPort,
        /* tcp = */ HostAndPort.fromParts(client.getAgent.getMember.getAddress, akkaManagement.settings.getHttpPort),
        /* interval = */ 10,
        /* name = */ "YOUR_SERVICE-akka-management",
        /* id = */ "YOUR_SERVICE-akka-management-8558",
        /* tags = */ Seq.empty[String].asJava,
        /* meta = */ Map.empty[String, String].asJava
      )
  }
  .recover {
    case err =>
      system.log.error(err, "Failed to start akka management")
  }

// Starting the bootstrap process needs to be done explicitly
ClusterBootstrap(system).start()
```

Note:

The binding of management service is set in `akka.management.http.hostname`, it should be exactly the same as

- the [`ServiceAddress`](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#serviceaddress) (usually a hostname), if it's not empty,
- or [`Address`](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#address-1) (usually an IP address), if the `ServiceAddress` is empty.

You may consider setting this config dynamically when the app starts, by:

```conf
akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.contact-point-discovery.service-name = YOUR_SERVICE
akka.management.http.hostname = ${app.privateIp}
```

And set `props` before actor system starts:

```scala
scala.sys.props += "app.privateIp" -> consulAgentClient.getAgent.getMember.getAddress
```
