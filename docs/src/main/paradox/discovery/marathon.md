## Marathon API

@@@ warning

This module is community maintained and the Lightbend subscription doesn't cover support for this module.
  It is also marked as @extref:[may change](akka:common/may-change.html).
  That means that the API, configuration or semantics can change without warning or deprecation period.

@@@

Marathon currently ignores all fields apart from service name. This is expected to change.

If you're a Mesos or DC/OS user, you can use the provided Marathon API implementation. You'll need to add a label
to your Marathon JSON (named `ACTOR_SYSTEM_NAME`  by default) and set the value equal to the name of the configured
effective name, which defaults to your applications actor system name.

You'll also have to add a named port, by default `akkamgmthttp`, and ensure that Akka Management's HTTP interface
is bound to this port.
